    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jack Barrington, nominal owner of Tinandra Downs cattle station on the
      Gilbert River in the far north of North Queensland, was riding slowly over
      his run, when, as the fierce rays of a blazing sun, set in a sky of brass,
      smote upon his head and shoulders and his labouring stock-horse plodded
      wearily homewards over the spongy, sandy soil, the lines of Barcroft Boake
      came to his mind, and, after he had repeated them mentally, he cursed
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>That's where the dead men lie!</i> Poor Boake must have thought of
      this God-forsaken part of an utterly God-forsaken country, I think, when
      he wrote 'Out where the Dead Men Lie.' For I believe that God Almighty has
      forgotten it! Oh for rain, rain, rain! Rain to send the Gilbert down in a
      howling yellow flood, and turn this blarsted spinifex waste of scorching
      sand and desolation into green grass&mdash;and save me and the youngsters
      from giving it best, and going under altogether.... Boake knew this cursed
      country well.... I wonder if he ever 'owned' a station&mdash;one with a
      raging drought, a thundering mortgage, and a worrying and greedy bank
      sooling him on to commit suicide, or else provide rain as side issues....
      I don't suppose he had a wife and children to leave to the mercy of the
      Australian Pastoralists' Bank. D&mdash;&mdash;n and curse the Australian
      Pastoralists' Bank, and the drought, and this scorching sand and hateful
      spinifex&mdash;and God help the poor cattle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew rein almost under the shade of a clump of stunted sandalwood,
      which had, in good seasons, been a favourite mustering camp, and looked
      about him, and then he passed his hand over his eyes to shut out for a few
      moments the melancholy spectacle before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that he pulled up &ldquo;almost&rdquo; under shelter; further he could not
      advance, for the hard, parched ground immediately under the shade of the
      sandalwoods was thickly covered by the stiffened sun-dried carcasses of
      some hundreds of dead cattle, which, having become too weak to leave the
      sheltering trees in search of food and water had lain down and died.
      Beyond, scattered singly and about in twos and threes, were the remains of
      scores of other wretched beasts, which, unable to drag themselves either
      to the sandy river-bed or to the scanty shade of the stunted timber, had
      perished where they fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a heavy sigh Harrington dismounted, took off his water-bag from the
      saddle, and pouring a little water into his hat, gave his horse a drink.
      Then he drank a few mouthfuls himself, filled and lit his pipe, and sat
      down, to rest awhile until the sun had lost its fierce intensity&mdash;and
      think.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he thought despairingly of the black prospect which for the past six
      or seven months had tormented him by day, and haunted him at night, broken
      now and then with a gleam of hope when the pitiless blue of the sky
      changed to grey, and rain seemed near, only to be followed by renewed and
      bitter disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot last much longer,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;even if rain came within a week
      the rest of the poor brutes left alive will be too weak to recover&mdash;and
      there's not hands enough on the station to cut leaves for them. Even the
      blacks have cleared out lower down the river... found a good water-hole I
      daresay, and, like wise niggers, are camping there. Why doesn't Providence
      give a poor honest bullock as much show for his life in a drought as a
      damned, filthy blackfellow! Instead of hoofs&mdash;in this part of the
      country at any rate&mdash;cattle ought to have feet like a bandicoot, then
      the poor beasts could worry along by digging waterholes in the river bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, sick at heart as he was, a faint smile flitted over his sun-bronzed
      face at the fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed, and Harrington, with another weary sigh, rose and saddled
      his horse&mdash;one of the few now remaining to him and able to carry a
      rider. Five miles away from the sandalwood camp was another and larger
      patch of timber&mdash;tall, slender brigalows, which grew on the edge of a
      dried-up swamp, once the haunt and breeding place of countless thousands
      of wild duck, teal, and geese. This was another of the mustering camps on
      Tinandra, and as it lay on his way home, he decided to go there and see if
      any of the &ldquo;Big Swamp&rdquo; cattle were still alive. As he rode slowly over
      towards the fringe of timber, the westering sun turned from a dazzling,
      blinding gold to a gradually deepening red; and his sweating horse gave a
      snort of satisfaction as the soft, spongy, and sandy spinifex country was
      left behind, and the creature's hoofs struck upon the hard sun-baked plain
      of yellow earth which lay between the two camps. Looking down at the
      great, widely spreading cracks in the hungry soil, the result of a
      seven-months' continuous drought, Harrington almost unconsciously bent his
      head and thought that surely God would send rain. He was not a religious
      man in the conventional sense&mdash;he had never been inside a church in
      his life&mdash;but the memory of his dead mother's belief in God's mercy
      and goodness was still strong within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brigalow scrub was about half a mile in length, and stood between the
      swamp and the high river bank. At the dried-up bed of the swamp itself he
      did not care to look a second time; its once reedy margin was now a sight
      of horror, for many hundreds of cattle had been bogged there long months
      before, as they had striven to get further out to the centre where there
      was yet left a little water, saved from evaporation by the broad leaves of
      the blue water-lilies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skirting the inner edge of the scrub till he reached its centre, he looked
      carefully among the timber, but not a beast was to be seen; then
      dismounting he led his horse through, came out upon the river bank, and
      looked across the wide expanse of almost burning sand which stretched from
      bank to bank, unbroken in its desolation except by a few ti-trees whose
      roots, deep down, kept them alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob, old fellow,&rdquo; he said to his horse, &ldquo;we've another ten miles to go,
      and there's no use in killing ourselves. I think that we can put in half
      an hour digging sand, and manage to raise a drink down there in the river
      bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still leading the animal, which seemed to know his master's intention,
      Harrington walked down the sloping bank, his long riding-boots sinking
      deeply into the fine, sandy soil, and Bob pricked up his ears and gave a
      true stock-horse sigh of weariness and anticipation combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the opposite side of the river bed and close under the bank were
      growing two or three heavy ti-trees, and here, just as the sun had set, he
      halted, again unsaddled, and after lighting a fire, began to scoop out a
      hole with his quart pot in between the roots of the trees. For some
      minutes he worked on with energy, then he stopped and listened, and Bob,
      too, turned his head inquiringly, for he also had heard the sound&mdash;it
      was only the cry of a beast, but it seemed so near that Harrington ceased
      his digging and stood up to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a hundred yards distant he saw, by the light of the now brightly
      blazing fire, four gaunt steers and a skeleton heifer, staggering and
      swaying over the river sand towards him in their weakness and agony of
      hunger and thirst The poor creatures had seen the man and the horse! As
      they toiled towards the light of the fire, a dreadful, wheezing moan came
      from the parched throat of the leading steer as it laboured pantingly over
      to something human&mdash;something it associated with water, and grass,
      and life, and presently the wretched animal, with one last effort, fell in
      its tracks almost at Harrington's feet. It lay there quiet enough for a
      minute or two, with lean, outstretched neck and one horn buried in the
      sand, its fast glazing eye turned to the man, and seeming to say, &ldquo;Give me
      water or death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harrington, wrought up and excited to the last pitch, flung himself upon
      his knees, and placed his cheek against that of the dying steer, and a sob
      burst from his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God, if there is a God! have mercy upon these Thy dumb creatures who
      suffer such agony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped up to his horse, took his revolver out of the pouch, and then a
      merciful bullet ended the sufferings of the thirst-stricken animal at his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, Bob, old man! Steady there!&rdquo; he said brokenly, &ldquo;I may have to do
      the same to you before long.&rdquo; And then, tearing off a long piece of dried
      ti-tree bark from one of the trees, he thrust it into the fire. Then, with
      the blazing torch in his left hand, and his pistol in his right, he
      tramped over the sand to the remaining cattle, and shot them dead one by
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then back to his digging again. A drink of thick, muddy water for his
      horse, and then with a dull sense of misery in his heart he led Bob up the
      bank and began the last stage of his ride home&mdash;home to his anaemic,
      complaining, shallow-brained wife and the weakly children who, instead of
      being the consolation of his life in his misfortunes, were an added and
      ever-present source of misery and despair.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few years before, Harrington had bought Tinandra Downs, and had stocked
      the run with three thousand head of store cattle; for half of which number
      he had paid, the remainder he had bought on long terms from a neighbouring
      squatter&mdash;a man who knew his sterling merits, and was confident that
      he (Harrington) would make Tinandra one of the best cattle stations in the
      far north. Fortune had smiled upon him from the first; for within two
      years came the discovery of the famous Palmer River goldfields, only a few
      hundred miles distant, and cattle and station properties doubled in value,
      for in less than half a year there were six thousand diggers on the field,
      and more came pouring in from the southern colonies by every steamer to
      Cooktown. New townships sprang suddenly into existence, provisions of all
      kinds brought an enormous price, and Harrington cleared off his debt to
      his squatter friend almost ere he could realise having done so, and that
      he had several thousands of pounds to the good as well. And his good luck
      stuck to him, for it was attended by careful management, and every mob of
      fat cattle he despatched to the goldfield instead of sending them on a
      three-hundred league journey to Brisbane, meant another couple of thousand
      sovereigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he began to improve the head station&mdash;and to think of Myra, a
      girl whom he had once met in Sydney, and who sent him newspapers, and,
      once or twice, at long intervals, had written him letters. He had answered
      these letters with a secret hope that, if all went well with him, he would
      take another trip to Sydney, and then&mdash;well, he could at least ask
      her. If she said no, why, who was there to chaff him? He was not a
      communicative man, had very few intimate men friends, and the few women
      whom he knew were not the sort he could possibly talk to about a lady.
      Both his parents had died before he was ten years of age, leaving him
      utterly alone in the world. Born in a bush town, in the interior of New
      South Wales, he had turned to the bush and to the wide, open, grassy
      plains, as an infant would have turned to its mother in its distress; and
      the bush and the plains and the grey mountain ranges had taken him to
      their bosoms; and the silent, reserved boy became the resolute, hardy
      bushman, stock-rider, and then miner&mdash;a man fit and ready to meet the
      emergencies of his rough life. Of the outside world he was as ignorant as
      a child, as indeed were most of the men with whom for many years he had
      associated. But there was nothing despicable in his ignorance; and when as
      time went on, and his improved circumstances threw him in contact with men
      and women of refinement and culture, he was quick to take advantage of
      such opportunities; but the honest, simple nature of the man always
      remained the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he was thirty, Harrington was known as one of the most experienced
      and fortunate over-lander drovers in Australia, and he became as familiar
      with the long and lonely stock-route from the stations on the Gulf of
      Carpentaria to Sydney and Melbourne, in his many journeys, as if it were a
      main road in an English county.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the conclusion of one of these tedious drives of seven months'
      duration, the brown-faced, quiet drover was asked by an acquaintance with
      whom he had business transactions, to spend the evening with him at his
      house. He went, and there met Myra Lyndon. He was attracted by her bright
      manner and smiling face, and when she questioned him about his life in the
      Far North, his adventures among the blacks, and the many perils of a
      drover's existence, he thought her the fairest and sweetest woman in the
      world. And Miss Myra Lyndon encouraged him in his admiration. Not that she
      cared for him in the least She had not reached eight-and-twenty years of
      age to throw herself away on a man who had no other ambition than to
      become a squatter and live amongst a lot of &ldquo;horrid bellowing cattle.&rdquo; But
      he was nice to talk to, though terribly stupid about some things, and so
      she did not mind writing to him once or twice&mdash;it would reward him
      for the horse he had one day sent to her father with a lamely worded note,
      saying that it was one of a mob he had just bought at the saleyards, and
      as he had no use for a lady's hack, he thought that perhaps Miss Lyndon
      would be so kind as to accept it Mr. Lyndon smiled as he read the note, he
      knew that drovers did not usually buy ladies' hacks; but being a man
      harassed to death with an expensive family, he was not disposed to
      discourage Harrington's attentions to Myra; though, having a conscience,
      he felt that Jack Harrington was too good a man for such a useless,
      empty-brained, and selfish creature as his eldest daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Harrington went back to his &ldquo;bellowing bullocks,&rdquo; and then, having
      saved enough money, bought the very run he had so often wished he could
      buy; and &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; Harrington, the overlander, became &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; John Harrington,
      the pastoralist and owner of Tinandra Downs, and then the vision of Myra
      Lyndon's face came to him very often&mdash;now that he was so prosperous.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he told his overseer that he was going to Sydney for a trip, and
      being a man of action, packed his valise, mounted his horse, and rode off
      on his journey of five hundred miles to the nearest seaport where he could
      take passage for Sydney.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first week or so after his arrival in the city, he &ldquo;mooned&rdquo; about
      doing nothing, and trying to pluck up courage enough to go to Myra Lyndon
      to ask her to be his wife. He had called several times upon her father and
      discussed business matters with him; but beyond inquiring after &ldquo;Mrs.
      Lyndon and the Misses Lyndon,&rdquo; had said nothing further, and in a nervous,
      shamefaced manner had each time accepted Mr. Lyndon's invitation to &ldquo;come
      and see the girls before he went back to the North,&rdquo; but had not had the
      courage to go. Next week, or the week after that, would do, he thought. If
      she said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he wouldn't feel it so much&mdash;once he was on his way
      North again in the old <i>Florence Irving</i>; he would put it off till
      just as he was ready to start. Then if she said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he would stay in
      Sydney as long as his love wished&mdash;a month&mdash;aye, six months, so
      long as she came back with him to Tinandra Downs. And Myra Lyndon, who
      knew from her father that her &ldquo;bullock-driver admirer,&rdquo; as she had
      mockingly called him to her friends, was in Sydney, waited for him
      impatiently. A systematic course of jilting and being jilted had made her
      feel anxious as to her future, and gall and wormwood had come to her now
      that her two younger sisters had married before her, and left her, as her
      somewhat acidulous-tongued mother said, &ldquo;the Lyndon family wallflower.&rdquo;
       She meant to marry him, spend a year or so among the &ldquo;beastly bellowing
      cattle,&rdquo; and then return to Sydney, where as Mrs. Harrington, the wealthy
      squatter's wife, she could enjoy herself thoroughly, snub some of the
      women she hated, and flirt with some of the men she liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late one night, Harrington, sauntering from the theatre to his hotel, met,
      to his intense astonishment, a man he knew&mdash;had known years before
      when he (Harrington) was a drover and the other man&mdash;Walters&mdash;was
      a mounted trooper in the Queensland police.
    </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands warmly, and then Walters said, &ldquo;Come along with me, Jack,
      to the Water Police Station; we can have a yarn there.... Oh, yes, I'm a
      Sydney man now&mdash;a full-fledged inspector of police... tell you all
      about it by and by. But, push along, old man. One of my men has just told
      me that a woman who jumped off the Circular Quay and tried to drown
      herself, is lying at the station, and is not expected to pull through.
      Hallo! here's a cab! Jump in, Jack; there's some whisky in the sergeant's
      room, and after I've seen the cadaver&mdash;if she has cadavered&mdash;we'll
      have a right down good yarn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cab rattled through the now almost deserted street, and in a few
      minutes Harrington and his friend alighted at a small stone building
      overlooking the waters of Sydney Harbour. A water-policeman, who stood at
      the door under the big gas-lamp, saluted the inspector and then showed
      Harrington into the sergeant's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes passed, and then Walters, accompanied by a big, stout,
      red-faced man, came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, here you are, old man. Jack, Dr. Parsons&mdash;the man who does the
      resuscitating and such silly business of this institution; Parsons, my old
      friend, Jack Harrington. Sergeant, where is that whisky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the woman dead, doctor?&rdquo; asked Harrington presently, as the sergeant's
      wife brought in a bottle of whisky and some glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the police doctor slowly, as he poured some whisky into his
      glass, &ldquo;she is not dead; but she may not live much longer&mdash;a day or
      so perhaps. It all depends. Shock to the system.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the usual sort, Parsons, I suppose?&rdquo; inquired Walters&mdash;&ldquo;left
      the baby on the wharf, with a written request for some 'kind Christian to
      love it,' eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fat doctor grunted. &ldquo;You're a beast, Walters. There's no baby in the
      case. Here, give me ten shillings&mdash;you'll spend more than that in
      drinks before you go to bed to-night This girl <i>isn't</i> one of the
      usual sort. She's a lady&mdash;and she's been starving. So ante-up, you
      ex-nigger-shooting Queensland policeman; and I'll add another half-sov.
      Then perhaps your friend will give me something for her. And I'm not going
      to send her off to the hospital. I'm going to take her to some people I
      know, and ask them to keep her for a few days until she gets round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harrington put his hand in his pocket, and then in a nervous, diffident
      way, looking first at Walters and then at the doctor, put five sovereigns
      on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm pretty flush now, you know.... I'm not a plunger, but I shall be
      glad, doctor, if you will take that and give it to her.... I was almost
      starving myself once&mdash;-<i>you</i> know, Walters, when I got the sack
      from the 'Morning Star' Mine for plugging the English manager when he
      called me a 'damned colonial lout.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fat-faced doctor looked steadily at him for a moment or two. Then he
      reached out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a good fellow, Mr. Harrington. I'll take a sovereign or two. Come
      in here with me.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harrington followed him into an adjoining room, where, upon a wicker-work
      couch was reclining the figure of a young girl. Standing beside her was
      the police-sergeant's wife, who, as soon as the two men came in, quietly
      drew aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, here I am back again, my dear child,&rdquo; said the doctor
      good-humouredly, &ldquo;and here is a very old friend of mine, Mr. Jack
      Harrington; and we have come to cheer you up and tell you that you have
      two or three good friends. And we won't let any women or parsons come to
      you and worry you, and tell you that you have been a wicked girl, and
      ought to have thrown yourself upon God's mercy and all that sort of thing.
      So just drink that coffee, and then by and by we will take you to some
      people I know well, and you shall come and tell us in a day or two how
      sorry you are for being so foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl's dark hazel eyes looked steadily at them both; then she put out
      a thin white hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind to me. I know it was very wicked to try and kill
      myself, but I was so lonely, and... and I had not eaten anything since
      Wednesday... and I wanted to die.&rdquo; Then she covered her face and sobbed
      softly, whilst the doctor patted her on the shoulder and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry, little girl; you are in good hands now. Never mind Mrs.
      Thornton and her un-kindness. You are better away from her&mdash;isn't
      she, Mr. Harrington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harrington, knowing nothing about Mrs. Thornton, promptly said &ldquo;Oh,
      most certainly,&rdquo; and the girl's eyes met his for a second, and a faint
      smile flushed upon her pale lips. The tall, bearded, and brown-faced man's
      face seemed so full of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you must go to sleep for an hour or two,&rdquo; said the doctor
      imperatively; &ldquo;so now then, little girl, 'seepy-by, beddy-bo.' That's what
      <i>my</i> mother used to say to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harrington followed the doctor out into the sergeant's room, where
      Inspector Walters, with his heels upon the table, was falling asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down a moment, Mr. Harrington,&rdquo; said Dr. Parsons, taking up a book
      which the sergeant had left upon the table; &ldquo;this is a sad case. Here is a
      girl, Nellie Alleyne, age 19, nursery governess to Mrs. Lavery-Thornton,
      of Waverly, jumped into the water off the Quay; rescued by Water-police
      Constables Casey and Boyce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harrington nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This girl has told me her story. She is alone and friendless in Sydney.
      She came out to Australia when she was seventeen, got a billet with this
      Mrs. Lavery-Thornton&mdash;who seems to be a perfect brute of a woman&mdash;suffered
      a two years' martyrdom, and then was dismissed from her situation with the
      large sum of twenty-two shillings in her pocket Tried to get another such
      position, but people wouldn't take her without a recommendation from her
      last place. The Thornton woman wouldn't give her one; said she was too
      independent. High-spirited girl with twenty-two shillings between her and
      starvation, wanders about from one registry office to another for a couple
      of weeks, living in a room in a Miller's Point slum; money all gone;
      pestered by brutes in the usual way, jumps into the water to end her
      miseries. Rough, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harrington nodded. &ldquo;Poor thing! I should like you, Dr. Parsons, to&mdash;to
      let her know that she <i>has</i> friends. Will you let me help. Fifty
      pounds or a hundred pounds won't hurt me... and I've been stone-broke
      myself. But a man can always peg along in the bush; and it's an awful
      thing for a child like that to be adrift in a big city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The kind-hearted police doctor looked steadily into Harrington's face for
      a moment, then he said quietly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An awful thing indeed. But there are some good men in the world, Mr.
      Harrington, who are able and willing to save pure souls from destruction.
      You are one of them. Tom Walters and myself are both hard-up devils&mdash;we
      see a lot of misery, but can do nothing to alleviate it; a few shillings
      is all we can give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harrington rose, and his sun-tanned face flushed as he drew out his
      cheque-book. &ldquo;I never try to shove myself in, in such matters as these,
      doctor, but I should feel pleased if you will let me help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he wrote out a cheque for fifty pounds, pushed it over to the doctor,
      said he thought it was getting late, and that he had better get back to
      his hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Parsons gave the sleeping inspector a shake, and in a few words told
      him what Harrington had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a dashed fool, old man,&rdquo; said Walters sleepily to Harrington;
      &ldquo;most likely she'll blue your fifty quid, and then blackmail&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's hand descended upon the inspector's shoulder. &ldquo;Shut up, you
      beastly old wretch&mdash;do you think <i>all</i> women are alike. Come,
      now, let us have another nip and get away. Mr. Harrington is tired.
      Sergeant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thompson, take good care of that young <i>lady</i>. We happen to know
      her. If she awakes before eight o'clock in the morning, tell her that she
      is to stay with your wife till I come to see her at nine o'clock. Any
      effects, sergeant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and the sergeant took out his note-book, &ldquo;seven pawn tickets,
      five pennies, and a New Testament with 'Nellie Alleyne' written inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, give me those tickets, I'll take care of them; and Thompson, if the
      newspaper fellows come here to-night, say that the young lady fell over
      the wharf accidentally, and has gone home to her friends. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, sir,&rdquo; said Thompson, as the good-hearted doctor slipped half a
      sovereign into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the three men stepped out into the street and strolled up to the
      Royal Hotel, and sat down in the smoking-room, which was filled with a
      noisy crowd, some of whom soon saw Walters and called him away, leaving
      the doctor and Harrington by themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better take this back, Mr. Harrington,&rdquo; and Dr. Parsons handed him his
      cheque. &ldquo;Two or three pounds will be quite enough for the poor girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Harrington with a smile, &ldquo;fifty pounds won't ruin me, as I
      said&mdash;and it may mean a lot to her, poor child. And I feel glad that
      I can help some one... some one who is all right, you know. Now I must be
      off. Good night, doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parsons looked at the tall manly figure as he pushed his way through the
      noisy crowd in the smoking-room, and then at the cheque in his hand.
      &ldquo;Well, there's a good fellow. Single man, I'll bet; else he wouldn't be so
      good to a poor little devil of a stranded girl. Didn't even ask her name.
      May the Lord send him a good wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lord did not send Harrington a good wife; for the very next day he
      called upon Mrs. Lyndon, and Mrs. Lyndon took good care that he should be
      left alone with Myra; and Myra smiled so sweetly at him, when with
      outstretched hands she came into the drawing-room, that he fatuously
      believed she loved him. And she of course, when he asked her to be his
      wife, hid her face on his shoulder, and said she could not understand why
      he could love <i>her</i>. Why, she was quite an old maid! Amy and Gwen
      were ever so much prettier than she, and she was sure that both Gwen and
      Amy, even though they were now both married, would feel jealous when they
      knew that big, handsome Jack Harrington had asked her to be his wife; and
      so on and so forth, as only the skilled woman of thirty, whose hopes of
      marriage are slipping by, knows how to talk and lie to an &ldquo;eligible&rdquo; man
      unused to women's ways. And Harrington kissed Myra's somewhat thin lips,
      and said&mdash;and believed&mdash;that he was the happiest man in
      Australia. Then Mrs. Lyndon came in, and, in the manner of mothers who are
      bursting with joy at getting rid of a daughter whose matrimonial prospects
      are looking gloomy, metaphorically fell upon Harrington's neck and wept
      down his back, and said he was robbing her of her dearest treasure, &amp;c.,
      &amp;c. Harrington, knowing nothing of conventional women's ways, believed
      her, and married, for him, the most unsuitable woman in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week or so after his marriage he received a letter from Dr. Parsons
      enclosing the cheque he had given him for Nellie Alleyne:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Harrington,&mdash;Girl won't take the cheque. Has a billet&mdash;cashier
      in a restaurant. Says she is writing to you. She's true gold. You ought to
      marry her and take her away with you to your outlandish parts. Would ask
      her to marry me&mdash;if I could keep her; but she wouldn't have me whilst
      you are about. Always glad to see you at my diggings; whisky and soda and
      such, and a hearty welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And by the same post came a letter from the girl herself&mdash;a letter
      that, simply worded as it was, sent an honest glow through his heart:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Dear Mr. Harrington,&mdash;I shall never, never forget your
     kindness to me; as long as I live I shall never forget Dr.
     Parsons tells me that you live in Queensland&mdash;more than a
     thousand miles from Sydney, and that you are going away
     soon. Please will you let me call on you before you go away?
     I shall be so unhappy if I do not see you again, because in
     a letter I <i>cannot</i> tell you how I thank you, how deeply
     grateful I am to you for your goodness and generosity to me.
     &ldquo;Yours very sincerely,

     &ldquo;Helen Alleyne.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Harrington showed the letter to Myra, who bubbled over with pretty
      expressions of sympathy and wrote and asked her to call. Nellie did call,
      and the result of her visit was that when Harrington took his newly
      married wife to Tinandra Downs, she went with her as companion. And from
      the day that she entered the door of his house, Helen Alleyne had proved
      herself to be, as Dr. Parsons had said, &ldquo;true gold.&rdquo; As the first bright
      years of prosperity vanished, and the drought and financial worries all
      but crushed Harrington under the weight of his misfortunes, and his
      complaining, irritable wife rendered his existence at home almost
      unbearable, her brave spirit kept his from sinking under the incessant
      strain of his anxieties. Mrs. Harrington, after her third child was born,
      had given up even the semblance of attending to the children, and left
      them to Nellie and the servants. She was doing quite enough, she once told
      her husband bitterly, in staying with him at such a horrible place in such
      a horrible country. But she nevertheless always went away to the sea-coast
      during the hottest months, and succeeded in having a considerable amount
      of enjoyment, leaving the children and Jack and Miss Alleyne to swelter
      through the summer at Tinandra Downs as best they could.

      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was nearly midnight as Harrington took down the slip-rails and led his
      horse through the paddock up to the house, which, except for a dimly
      burning lamp in the dining-room, was in darkness. The atmosphere was close
      and sultry, and the perspiration ran down his skin in streams as he gave
      his horse to the head-stockman, who was sitting on the verandah awaiting
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terrible night, sir, but I'm thinking if it keeps on like this for
      another hour or two we'll get a big thunderstorm. 'Sugar-bag'&rdquo; (one of the
      black boys) &ldquo;was here just now and says that the ant-heaps about are
      covered with ants&mdash;that's a sure sign, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God send it so, Banks! If no rain comes within two days, you'll have to
      start away for Cleveland Bay with Mrs. Harrington and Miss Alleyne and the
      children. We must find horses somehow to take them there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Banks led the horse away for a drink, he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Alleyne went to Canton Reef, sir, this morning with little Sandy.
      She ought to have been here before dark, but I expect the horses knocked
      up. There's a couple of cows with young calves there, so Sandy says, and
      Miss Alleyne said she would try and bring them in if I would let her take
      Sandy. We've had no milk, sir, for the children since Tuesday, and Miss
      Alleyne said that you would be vexed. I would have gone myself, sir, but I
      couldn't well leave, and I know Miss Alleyne will manage&mdash;it's only
      fifteen miles, and Sandy says that the two cows and calves are pretty fat
      and can travel; there's a bit of feed at those waterholes about the
      Canton. Most likely she and the little black boy have yarded the cows at
      the Seven-mile Hut and are camping there for the night But I'll start off
      now, sir. I've got Peter the Pig already saddled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Banks, certainly. Why didn't you start long ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Harrington said I must wait for you, sir,&rdquo; the man answered somewhat
      sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harrington nodded. &ldquo;Hurry up, Banks; but here, take a glass of grog
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched the stockman disappear down the dusty track to the slip-rails,
      then he went inside, and sitting down at the table buried his face in his
      hands. Then, booted and dusty, and tired in mind and body, he slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour had passed, and no sound disturbed the hot oppressive silence of
      the night but the heavy breathing of the wearied man. Then through his
      dreamless slumber came the murmur of voices, and presently three figures
      walked quickly up from the milking-yard towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's asleep, miss,&rdquo; whispered Banks, &ldquo;he's dog tired But the news you
      have got for him will put fresh life into him. Now just you go to him,
      miss, and tell him, and then as soon as I have given them cows a drink,
      I'll bring you in some tea. Sandy, you little black devil, light a fire in
      the kitchen and don't make a noise, or I'll tan your hide, honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or so the girl stood in the doorway of the dining-room,
      holding a heavy saddle-pouch, in her hand, her frame trembling with
      emotion and physical exhaustion; and trying to speak. As soon as she could
      speak, she walked over to the sleeping man and touched him on the shoulder
      He awoke with a start just as she sank on her knees, and leaning her
      elbows on a chair beside him, burst into a fit of hysterical weeping. He
      waited for her to recover herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad, so glad, Mr. Harrington! Now you need not give up
      Tinandra... and the drought doesn't matter... and oh, I thank God for His
      goodness that He has let me help you at last!&rdquo; She broke off with a
      choking sob, and then, with streaming eyes, placed her hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harrington lifted her up and placed her on a couch. &ldquo;Lie there, Miss
      Alleyne. I will call Mrs. Harrington&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put out her hand beseechingly. &ldquo;Please <i>don't</i>, Mr. Harrington.
      She is not at all strong, and I think I made her very angry this morning
      by going away to look for the milkers.... But look, Mr. Harrington, look
      inside the saddle pouch.&rdquo; Then she sat up, and her eyes burnt with
      feverish expectation, &ldquo;Quick, quick, please,&rdquo; and then she began to laugh
      wildly, but clenching her hands tightly together she overcame her
      hysteria, and attempted to speak calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be better in a minute... empty it out on the table, please...
      Banks says it is another outcrop of the old Canton Reef.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harrington picked up the saddle-pouch, and putting it on the table, turned
      up the lamp, and unfastened the straps; it was filled with pieces of rough
      weather-worn quartz thickly impregnated with gold. The largest piece
      contained more gold than quartz, and an involuntary cry of astonishment
      and admiration burst from his lips as he held it to the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nellie's eyes sparkled with joy. &ldquo;Isn't it lovely! I can't talk, my lips
      are so dry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harrington dashed outside to the verandah filled a glass from the canvas
      water-bag hanging from a beam overhead, and gave it to the exhausted girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't you attempt to speak for five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won't,&rdquo; she said, with a faint smile, as she drank off the cold
      water&mdash;and then at once began to tell him of her discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sandy and I found the two cows and calves a mile this side of the Canton
      Reef in a gully, but before we could head them off they had got away into
      the ironbark ridges. Sandy told me to wait, and galloped after them. I
      followed him to the top of the first ridge, and then pulled up, and there,
      right under my horse's feet I saw a small 'blow' of quartz sticking up out
      of the baked ground, and I saw the gold in it quite plainly. Of course I
      was wildly excited, and jumped off. The stone was quite loose and crumbly,
      and I actually pulled some pieces away with my hands, and when I saw the
      thick yellow gold running all through it I sat down and cried. Then I
      became so frightened that Sandy might not find me again, for it would be
      dark in another hour, and so I ran up and down along the ridge, listening
      for the sound of his stockwhip. And then I went back towards the outcrop
      of the reef again, and half-way down I picked up that big lump&mdash;it
      was half buried in the ground.... And oh, Mr. Harrington, all that ridge
      is covered with it... I could have brought away as much again, but Sandy
      had no saddle-pouch... and I was dying to come home and tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She breathed pantingly for a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was nearly dark when Sandy came back. He had run the cattle on to a
      camp about three miles away.... I don't know which pleased me most, to get
      the cows so that poor Mable and Harry can have some milk in the morning,
      or the gold.... Banks met us half-way from the Seven-mile Hut, and took me
      off my horse and put me in front of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Banks came to the door, carrying a tray with a cup of tea and some food.
      &ldquo;Here ye are, Miss Alleyne; ye're a born stockman, an' a prospector, an'&mdash;God
      bless you, miss, <i>you've brought the rain as well</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For as the rough, hairy-faced stockman began to speak, a low rumbling
      sound of thunder smote the silence of the night, followed by a loud
      appalling clap, and then another, and another, and presently a cooling
      blast of wind came through the open door, and stirred and shook the
      Venetian blinds hanging outside. Banks almost dropped the tea-tray, and
      then darting outside, dashed his cabbage-tree hat on the ground, and began
      to dance as the first heavy drops of the coming deluge fell upon his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than ten minutes, Harrington, with silent joy in his heart, was
      standing at the doorway, watching the descending torrents of rain&mdash;that
      rain which to his bushman's heart meant more than all the gold which lay
      beneath the earth. He had, as it first began to fall, rushed into his
      wife's bedroom, and kissed her and the terrified children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rain has come, Myra, thank God,&rdquo; he said, and then he added quietly,
      &ldquo;I have more good news for you in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Harrington said she was quite aware of the rain having come&mdash;the
      disgusting noise of the thunder had made the children scream. Had Miss
      Alleyne come back? And brought the cows? His other good news could keep
      till the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harrington turned away from her with a feeling of dulled resentment. <i>He</i>
      knew what the girl had suffered, and his wife's heartlessness cut him to
      the quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood watching Banks and the black boys filling every available tank
      and cask on the station from the downpour off the roof, Nellie rose from
      the couch on which she had been lying, and touched his arm timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you believe in God's goodness <i>now</i>, Mr. Harrington? See, He
      has sent the rain, and He has granted my daily prayer to Him that I, too,
      might help you. And Banks says that this is not a passing thunderstorm,
      but that the drought has broken up altogether&mdash;for see, the wind is
      from the south.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harrington raised her hand to his lips. &ldquo;I have always tried to believe in
      God and in His mercy, Miss Alleyne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always, Mr. Harrington,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Don't you remember when
      all the Big Swamp! mob were bogged and dying, that you said that if He
      would not hear the moans and see the agonies of the beasts He had created,
      that He would not listen to the prayers of human beings who were not
      suffering as they suffered? And to-day, as Sandy and I rode along to the
      Canton Reef, I prayed again and again, and always when I passed a dying
      beast I said, '<i>O God! have mercy upon these Thy dumb creatures who
      suffer much agony!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harrington's chest heaved. &ldquo;And I prayed as you prayed, Miss Alleyne; but
      I said, 'O God! if there is a God.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put out her hand to him and her dark eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;He has
      answered our prayers.... And now, good night... I wish I could go out into
      the rain; I feel I could dance for joy.... Mr. Harrington, <i>do</i> let
      me go to the Canton Reef with you to-morrow. Everything will be all right
      to-morrow, won't it? But there, how thoughtless I am.... I am going to
      milk those two cunning cows till they are dry; poor little Harry does so
      want some fresh milk. Good night, Mr. Harrington; I shall sleep happily
      to-night&mdash;everything will be all right to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast-time next morning the rain was still falling steadily, and
      Mrs. Harrington decided to join her husband at the morning meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harrington rode up to the door and smiled brightly at his wife. &ldquo;Waiting
      for me, dear? I won't be long. The river is running now, Myra&mdash;running
      after two years! I'm off to Miss Alleyne's reef as soon as I've had a bit
      of tucker. Where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In bed, I presume,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harrington acidulously. &ldquo;She might have
      remembered that I was very much upset last night by that horrible thunder,
      and have risen earlier and attended to the children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of intense disgust came over her husband's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myra, the girl was done-up, dead beat! Won't you go and see if she is
      able to get up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Harrington rose stiffly. &ldquo;Oh, certainly, if you wish it. But I think
      it is a great mistake. She really ought to have considered the children,
      and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The head stockman's wife met her at the door, and looking past her
      mistress, spoke to Harrington in terrified tones&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Alleyne is dead, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harrington sprang from his chair. &ldquo;Dead, Mrs. Banks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I was only just in time. She on'y sez, 'Tell Mr. Harrington
      that I am so glad that everythink will be all right now.' An' then she
      smiled, sir, and sez as I was to kiss Master Harry and Miss Mabel for her,
      as she was agoin'. And then she sez, 'Isn't God good to send the rain,
      Mrs. Banks? Everything will be all right now for poor Mr. Harrington&mdash;rain
      and gold.' Then she just laid quiet for a minute, an' when I looked at her
      face again, I saw she was dead.&rdquo;
     </p>

      A year later, Jack Harrington, again one of the wealthiest cattle men in
      North Queensland, and the owner of one of the richest gold mines in the
      colony, was riding home to his station. Behind him he heard the clatter
      and clash of the twenty-stamper battery that on the &ldquo;Canton Ridge&rdquo; was
      pounding him in so many thousands of pounds a month; before him lay the
      sweeping grassy downs and thickly timbered creeks of a now smiling
      country. His wife and children had long before returned to the cooler
      South, and in his heart was a great loneliness. Not, perhaps, for them,
      but because of the memory of the girl whose prayer to the Almighty had
      been answered, and who was resting on the bank of the Gilbert under the
      shade of a big Leichhardt tree.
